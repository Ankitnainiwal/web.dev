## Web safe fonts

If you have been doing web development for long enough, you may remember the set of the so-called [web safe fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Web_safe_fonts). These fonts are known to be available on nearly all instances of the most used operating systems (namely Windows, macOS, the most common Linux distributions, Android, and iOS). In the early 2000s, Microsoft even spearheaded an [initiative](https://web.archive.org/web/20020124085641/http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm) called *TrueType core fonts for the Web* that provided these fonts for download for free with the objective that *"whenever you visit a Web site that specifies them, you'll see pages exactly as the site designer intended"*. Yes, including sites set in [Comic Sans MS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/comic-sans-ms). A classic web safe font stack (with the ultimate fallback of whatever
[`sans-serif`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family#<generic-name>:~:text=sans%2Dserif,-Glyphs)
font) might look like this:

```css
body {
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

## Web fonts

The days where web safe fonts really mattered are long gone. Today, we have [web fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Web_fonts), some of which even are [variable fonts](/variable-fonts/) that we can tweak further. You can use web fonts by declaring a
[`@font-face`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face)
block at the start of the CSS, which specifies the font file(s) to download:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "FlamboyantSansSerif";
  src: url("flamboyant.woff2");
}
```

After this, you can then use the custom web font by specifying the
[`font-family`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family),
as normal:

```css
body {
  font-family: "FlamboyantSansSerif";
}
```

## Local fonts as fingerprint vector

Most web fonts come from, well, the web. An interesting fact, though, is that the
[`src`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/src)
property in the `@font-face` declaration, apart from the
[`url()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/src#Values:~:text=%3Curl%3E%20%5B%20format(%20%3Cstring%3E%23%20)%20%5D%3F,-Specifies)
function, also accepts a
[`local()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/src#format():~:text=downloaded.-,%3Cfont%2Dface%2Dname%3E)
function. This allows custom fonts to be loaded, surprise, locally. If the user happens to have *FlamboyantSansSerif* installed on their operating system, rather than downloading it from the web, the local copy would be used:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "FlamboyantSansSerif";
  src: local("FlamboyantSansSerif"),
       url("flamboyant.woff2");
}
```

This approach provides a nice fallback mechanism that potentially saves the user bandwidth. On the Internet, unfortunately, we cannot have nice things. The problem with the `local()` function is that it can be abused for browser fingerprinting. Turns out, the list of fonts a user has installed can be pretty identifying. A lot of companies have their own corporate fonts that are installed on employees' laptops. For example, Google has a corporate font called *Google Sans*.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled"
       src="google-sans.png"
       alt="The macOS Font Book app showing a preview of the Google Sans font.">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    The Google Sans font installed on a Google employee's laptop.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

An attacker can try to determine what company someone potentially works for by programmatically testing for the existence of a large number of known corporate fonts like *Google Sans*. Therefore, the attacker would attempt rendering text set in these fonts on a canvas and measure the glyphs. If the glyphs match the known shape of the corporate font, the attacker has a hit. If the glyphs do not match, the attacker knows that a default replacement font was used since the corporate font was not installed. For full details on this and other browser fingerprinting attacks, read the [survey paper](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/papers/Lape-etal-20-TWEB.pdf) by Laperdix *et al.*

Company fonts apart, even just the pure list of installed fonts can be identifying.
The situation with this attack vector has become so bad that recently the WebKit team [decided](https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention/#table-of-contents-toggle:~:text=Changed%20font%20availability%20to%20web%20content,but%20not%20locally%20user%2Dinstalled%20fonts) to *"only include [in the list available fonts] web fonts and fonts that come with the operating system, but not locally user-installed fonts"*. And here I am, with an article on granting access to local fonts.

## The Local Font Access API

The beginning of this article may have put you in a negative mood. Can we really not have nice things? Fret not. We think we can, and maybe [everything is not hopeless](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html#Blog1:~:text=like-,hopeless). But first, let me answer a question that you might be asking yourself.

### Why are web fonts not good enough?

Professional-quality design and graphics tools have historically been difficult to deliver on the web. One stumbling block has been an inability to access and use the full variety of professionally constructed and hinted fonts that designers have locally installed. Web fonts enable some publishing use-cases, but fail to fully enable high-fidelity, platform independent vector-based design tools for several reasons:

- System font engines (and browser stacks) may handle the parsing and display of certain glyphs differently. These differences are necessary, in general, to create fidelity with the underlying OS (so web content does not "look wrong").
- Developers may have legacy font stacks for their applications that they are bringing to the web. To use these stacks, they usually require direct access to font data; something web fonts do not provide.
- Some fonts may not be licensed for delivery over the web. For example, Linotype has a license for some fonts that only includes [desktop use](https://www.linotype.com/25/font-licensing.html).

The Local Font Access API is an attempt at solving these challenges. It consists of two parts:

- A **font enumeration API** which may, optionally, allow users to grant access to the full set of available system fonts in addition to network fonts.
- From each enumeration result, the ability to request low-level (byte-oriented) **font table access** to the various [TrueType/OpenType tables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otff#font-tables).

### Current status {: #status }

<div class="w-table-wrapper">

### How to use the Local Font Access API

#### Enabling via chrome://flags

To experiment with the Local Font Access API locally, enable the `#font-access` flag in `chrome://flags`.

#### Feature detection

To check if the Local Font Access API is supported, use:

```js
if ('fonts' in navigator) {
  // The Local Font Access API is supported
}
```

#### Enumerating local fonts

Access to a user's local fonts is gated behind the `"local-fonts"` permission
that you can request with
[`navigator.permissions.request()`](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#requesting-more-permission).
Once the permission has been granted, you can then, from the `FontManager` interface that
is exposed on `navigator.fonts`, call `query()` to ask the browser
for the locally installed fonts.
This results in an asynchronous iterator that you can loop over in a
[`for await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of)
statement.
Each font is represented as a `FontMetadata` object with the properties
`family` (for example, `"Comic Sans MS"`), `fullName` (for example, `"Comic Sans MS"`),
and `postscriptName` (for example, `"ComicSansMS"`).

{% Aside 'warning' %}
  In this early phase of development of the Local Font Access API,
  the permission mentioned above is not yet implemented.
{% endAside %}

```js
(async () => {
  // Ask for permission to use the API
  const status = await navigator.permissions.request({
    name: 'local-fonts',
  });
  if (status.state !== 'granted') {
    throw new Error('Permission to access local fonts not granted.');
  }

  // Query for all available fonts and log metadata.
  const fonts = navigator.fonts.query();
  for await (const metadata of fonts) {
    console.log(metadata.postscriptName);
    console.log(metadata.fullName);
    console.log(metadata.family);
  }
})();
```

#### Accessing font tables

Each `FontMetadata` object exposes the available tables
as a `FontTableMap` via the asynchronous `getTables()` method.
You can list the tables in a
[`for...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)
statement.
If you know what you are looking for, you can also pass the desired table name
as a string (for example, `'glyf'`), or multiple table names
as an array parameter (for example, `['glyf', 'name']`) to `getTables()`.
All available tables and what they are useful for are described in the
[OpenType spec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/).
To be of use, font table data must be consumed by a shaping engine
such as [HarfBuzz](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz/),
in conjunction with Unicode libraries such as [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/home)
for bidirectional text support, text segmentation, and so on.
To get an impression of the available table data, you can browse the
[opentype.js](https://github.com/opentypejs/opentype.js) project's
[font inspector](https://opentype.js.org/font-inspector.html) and their
[glyph inspector](https://opentype.js.org/glyph-inspector.html).

```js
(async () => {
  // Ask for permission to use the API
  const status = await navigator.permissions.request({
    name: 'local-fonts',
  });
  if (status.state !== 'granted') {
    throw new Error('Permission to access local fonts not granted.');
  }

  const fonts = navigator.fonts.query();
  for await (const metadata of fonts) {
    // We're only interested in a particular font.
    if (metadata.family !== 'Comic Sans MS') {
      continue;
    }
    // `getTables()` returns Blobs of table data. The default is
    // to return all available tables. For details on the tables, see:
    // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/.
    const tables = await metadata.getTables();
    for (const [name, blob] of tables) {
      console.log(name, blob);
    }
    // Looking at the `head` table.
    const blob = tables.get('head');

    // Slice out only the bytes we need.
    const bytes = new DataView(await blob.slice(0, 4).arrayBuffer());

    // Parse out the version number of the font:
    // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/head
    const major = bytes.getInt16(0);
    const minor = bytes.getInt16(2);
    console.log(`Version: ${major}.${minor}.`);
  }
})();
```

#### Accessing SFNT data

Full [SFNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFNT)
access is available via the `blob()` method of the `FontMetadata` object.
SFNT is a font file format which can contain other fonts, such as PostScript, TrueType, OpenType,
Web Open Font Format (WOFF) fonts and others.

```js
(async () => {
  // Ask for permission to use the API
  const status = await navigator.permissions.request({
    name: 'local-fonts',
  });
  if (status.state !== 'granted') {
    throw new Error('Permission to access local fonts not granted.');
  }

  const fonts = navigator.fonts.query();
  for await (const metadata of fonts) {
    // We're only interested in a particular font.
    if (metadata.family !== 'Comic Sans MS') {
      continue;
    }
    // `blob()` returns a Blob containing valid and complete
    // SFNT-wrapped font data.
    const sfnt = await metadata.blob();

    const sfntVersion = (new TextDecoder).decode(
        // Slice out only the bytes we need: the first 4 bytes are the SFNT
        // version info.
        // Spec: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otff#organization-of-an-opentype-font
        await sfnt.slice(0, 4).arrayBuffer());

    let outlineFormat = 'UNKNOWN';
    switch (sfntVersion) {
      case '\x00\x01\x00\x00':
      case 'true':
      case 'typ1':
        outlineFormat = 'truetype';
        break;
      case 'OTTO':
        outlineFormat = 'cff';
        break;
    }
    console.log('Outline format:', outlineFormat);
  }
})();
```

## Demo

You can see the Local Font Access API in action in the
[demo](https://local-font-access.glitch.me/demo/) below.
Be sure to also check out the
[source code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/local-font-access?path=README.md%3A1%3A0).
The demo showcases a custom element `<font-select>` that implements a local font picker.

<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 500px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/local-font-access?path=index.html&previewSize=100"
    title="local-font-access on Glitch"
    allow="local-fonts"
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

## Privacy considerations

The `"local-fonts"` permission appears to provide a highly fingerprintable surface.
However, browsers are free to return anything they like.
For example, anonymity-focused browsers may choose to only provide
a set of default fonts built into the browser.
Similarly, browsers are not required to provide table data exactly as it appears on disk.

Wherever possible, the Local Font Access API is designed to only expose exactly the information
needed to enable the mentioned use cases.
System APIs may produce a list of installed fonts not in a random or a sorted order,
but in the order of font installation.
Returning exactly the list of installed fonts given by such a system API
can expose additional entropy bits, and use cases we want to enable
are not assisted by retaining this ordering.
As a result, this API requires that the returned data be sorted before being returned.

## Security and permissions

The Chrome team has designed and implemented the Local Font Access API using the core principles defined in [Controlling Access to Powerful Web Platform Features][powerful-apis], including user control, transparency, and ergonomics.

### User control

Access to a user's fonts is fully under their control and will not be allowed unless the `"local-fonts"` permission, as listed in the
[permission registry](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#permission-registry), is granted.

### Transparency

The fact whether a site has been granted access to the user's local fonts will be visible in the *site information* sheet.

### Permission persistence

The `"local-fonts"` permission will be persisted between page reloads. It can be revoked via the *site information* sheet.

## Feedback {: #feedback }

The Chrome team wants to hear about your experiences with the Local Font Access API.

### Tell us about the API design

Is there something about the API that does not work like you expected? Or are there missing methods or properties that you need to implement your idea? Have a question or comment on the security model?
File a spec issue on the corresponding [GitHub repo][issues], or add your thoughts to an existing issue.

### Report a problem with the implementation

Did you find a bug with Chrome's implementation? Or is the implementation different from the spec?
File a bug at [new.crbug.com](https://new.crbug.com). Be sure to include as much detail as you can, simple instructions for reproducing, and enter `Blink>Fonts` in the **Components** box. [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) works great for sharing quick and easy repros.

### Show support for the API

Are you planning to use the Local Font Access API? Your public support helps the Chrome team to prioritize features and shows other browser vendors how critical it is to support them.

Send a Tweet to [@ChromiumDev][cr-dev-twitter] with the `#LocalFontAccess` hashtag and let us know where and how you're using it.
